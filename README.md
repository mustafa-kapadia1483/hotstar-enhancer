An simple extension to remove the hotstar / live watermark when a video is viewed in full screen on hotstar.com

## Why did I create this extension ?

I have a OLED laptop and me overthing about OLED burn in combined with the irritation I felt when I saw the watermark even for movies / shows I decided to create this extension for me and my friends.
